Hi,


thank you very much for your message :)

We work hard on answering every bug report and support message as quickly as possible.
While you are waiting, another great source for answers is our FAQ section.

Due to the high amount of feature requests we receive, we might not respond to these right away. 
But be assured that we are very thankful that you took the time to submit your 
suggestion and that we read every single one of them.


Best,

Your Support Team
